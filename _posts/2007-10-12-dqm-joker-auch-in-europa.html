Da kümmert man sich einen Tag der momentan anhaltenden News-Flaute wegen nicht um Dragon Quest News, schon gibts was wirklich interessantes zu berichten! Tatsächlich kommt <em>Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker</em> nach Europa! Das Spiel soll Anfang 2008 hier erscheinen. Über eine Übersetzung ist nichts bekannt, allerdings darf man davon ausgehen, dass auch deutsche Texte im Spiel enthalten sein werden. Der Joker's GP wurde übrigens in <em>Wildcard World Cup</em> umbenannt, ansonsten enthält die Pressemitteilung keine neuen Informationen.
