<img id="image1630" src="http://dragonquest.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ctart.jpg" alt="Chrono Trigger" width="150" height="117" class="right" />In einer Pressemitteilung gibt Square Enix bekannt, dass die DS Fassung von <strong>Chrono Trigger</strong> bereits am 25.11.2008 in Nordamerika erscheinen wird! Der Termin für die EU Fassung liegt immer noch bei "diesem Winter", was natürlich von der Vorweihnachtszeit bis zum Februar 2009 alles bedeuten kann.

In der Pressemitteilung stehen ansonsten nur die bereits bekannten Informationen, allerdings wird ein kleines Wort über die Bonusfeatures der DS Fassung verloren. So gibt es nicht nur einen komplett neuen Dungeon, es ist sogar von mehreren Dungeons die Rede. Außerdem wird von einem "Arena-Modus" gesprochen, was auch immer das heißen mag. Hier müssen wir wohl die ersten Previews oder Infos der offiziellen Webseiten abwarten.

Nebenbei wurde auch die europäische Fassung des Action-RPGs <strong>Dragon Ball DS</strong> angekündigt. Das Spiel erscheint als <em>Dragon Ball: Origins</em> im Dezember in Europa. Lokalisiert wird das Spiel von Infogrames bzw. Atari in Frankreich.

Im folgenden nun die beiden Pressemitteilungen.

<strong>Dragon Ball: Origins</strong>

<blockquote><em>RELIVE ORIGINAL DRAGON BALL ADVENTURES WITH 'DRAGON BALL: ORIGINS' ON NINTENDO DS

Innovative Action-Adventure Gameplay of NAMCO BANDAI Games' Newest Chapter in the Dragon Ball Saga for DS Comes to Europe in December 2008


LYON, FRANCE – 19 August 2008 – The Dragon Ball bounces back with the announcement that Atari is bringing NAMCO BANDAI Games’ Dragon Ball: Origins for Nintendo DS™ to European shores in December 2008. Developed by NAMCO BANDAI Games Inc., Dragon Ball: Origins takes players back to the original Dragon Ball series and around the world for a thrilling action-adventure game with innovative touch pad controls.

The single player game follows Goku and his clever sidekick Bulma as they travel the world overcoming enemies and obstacles to collect the 7 Dragon Balls. In the shoes of Goku, the player must protect Bulma from incoming enemy attacks using special skills, such as fighting with his power pole, or unleashing a kamehameha. Combined with Bulma’s ability to invent machines and weapons, the intrepid pair make a formidable team able to defeat even the strongest enemies or trickiest of obstacles.

The innovative controls mean the player uses only the touch pad to control Goku. Players must draw lines or shapes to direct the character and control the action by tapping on the screen, for example a double tap on Goku followed by tapping on the Ka-me-ha-me-ha letters unleashes his devastating signature move.

Goku can perfect his skills by gaining experience through defeating strong enemies. Goku’s power pole helps him and Bulma not only in the battle but also in solving puzzles throughout the game. For extra Dragon Ball fun, hunt down and collect the many virtual figurines hidden in the game world which can then be swapped and traded with friends via the wireless connection to get the full collection.

Dragon Ball: Origins pulls no punches in terms of graphics with both screens displaying vibrant 3D visuals, and with the lively, fun humour of Dragon Ball present throughout the game, fans will be able to immerse themselves completely in the spectacular universe.
