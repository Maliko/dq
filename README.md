==============

Backup of my old Dragon Quest website. Just the contents. In Jekyll.


## HTML

Found an old backup of my Dragon Quest Website, a project which I worked on between 2001 and roughly 2011. After that, real life struck (plus, the series wore off). Here you'll find generated HTML files, without the images. Install Jekyll, then type

```
jekyll serve
```

To view what's in there.

## XML

`wordpress.xml` is an export of the actual WP Database.

## Usage

Feel free to use and include all the contents for whatever project you have. Just put an Link on those pages to this repository. Thanks a bunch
